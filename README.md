- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - The React component library you always wanted.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
